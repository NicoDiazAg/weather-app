# Weather Application ðŸŒ¦

This consists of a weather-data-fetching application that takes a city's name and displays the current temperature, humidity, a description, and an emoji according to openweathermap.org's API. This was the final project for the JavaScript course from BroCode, but I modified and added a few minor improvements.
